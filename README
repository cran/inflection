Changes from version 1.1:
1)the function eixf(x, y, f, i) was removed as not essentially necessary
2)new functions with self declaring names were added:
*ese(x,y,index)
*bese(x,y,index)
*ede(x,y,index)
*edeci(x,y,index)
*bede(x,y,index)
All functions require length(x)>=4 in order to create numeric output
3)function findipiterplot(x,y,index) was improved and became 
 findipiterplot(x, y, index, plots = TRUE, crossrun = FALSE, ci = FALSE)
4)changes in NAMESPACE, added folder inst/CITATION
5)reference to new paper:
