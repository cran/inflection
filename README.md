###Why should I use inflection package in R?
* Because it does not imply any kind of functional hypothesis for the data under examination
* Because it can give you an estimation despite the level of noise added to initial data
* Because it is fast and can use parallel computing if you ask for it
* Due to its simplicity it can handle data sets with more than a million rows in negligible execution time
* It uses sophisticated iterative methods like bisection of Numerical Analysis and locates the inflection point when it is not directly visible form the first sight
